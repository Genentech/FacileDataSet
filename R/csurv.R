#' @name cSurv
#' @title cSurv is a character representation of survival::surv ###
#'
#' @description cSurv serves as a more reliable way to use Surv objects as data.frame columns. A
#' data.frame is supposed to be able to hold Surv columns. There are multiple special
#' cases written into base for this. It seems the implementation is incomplete as
#' subsetting the DF breaks the Surv object. cSurv cannot do anything but get subset
#' and become a Surv again. In the FacileVerse we hold Surv objects as cSurv, which
#' allows us to survive a round-trip through an EAV sample metadata table. Survival
#' analyses can convert cSurv to Surv as needed. It is assumed that all Surv censoring
#' is right-censored.

#' x2 = as.character(x)
#' z2 = as(x2, "Surv")
#' a = as(x, "cSurv")
